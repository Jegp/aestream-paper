# AEStream-paper

This repository contains instructions as well as code to reproduce the findings in the paper [AEStream: Accelerated event-based processing with coroutines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10719).

## Installation instructions

We assume [AEStream](https://github.com/norse/aestream) to be installed at > v.0.4.
Additionally, we require CMake and a C++20 compiler with support for coroutines.

## Reproducing C++ benchmarks

```bash
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -Gninja ..
$ ./aestream-paper
```

## Reproducing GPU benchmarks
Install the GPU version of PyTorch along with  [the spiking neural network simulator Norse](https://github.com/norse/norse).
Then run:

```bash
$ python3 src/gpu_benchmark.py
```

## Reproducing plots

1. Start a [Jupyter Notebook server](https://jupyter.org/)
2. Execute the `plots.ipynb`
