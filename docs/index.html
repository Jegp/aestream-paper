        <h2 id="intro">Introduction: the problem with processing events</h2>
        <figure>
            <img src="2212_NICE_coroutines.svg" alt="Coroutines vs buffers" />
            <figcaption><b>(A)</b> A reading thread (blue) creates buffers that are processed by other threads.
                <b>(B)</b> Coroutines concurrently processes events, which means that they are free to run on other
                threads without synchronization.<figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            Neuromorphic sensors imitate the sparse and event-based communication seen in biological sensory organs and
            brains. Today's
            sensors can emit many millions of asynchronous events per second.
            For modern computers to cope with that they need to process events in parallel.
            Unfortunately, that requires synchronization mechanisms between threads and processes which takes up a large
            part of our
            processes.
        </p>
        <p>Panel <b>(A)</b> in the figure above illustrates the problem: every time an input thread passes over some
            work, time is spent to coordinate the work.
            Because of this cost, threads typically bundle events into buffers to amortize the cost.
            Panel <b>(B)</b> shows another method that do not require memory locks and that can operate directly on
            events: coroutines.</p>
        <p>Coroutines were designed in 1958 as a way to pass control between functions, without
            the need
            for centralized synchronization. In theory, this means that coroutines on multicore systems can maximize
            core
            utilization
            without the overhead of locks. We set out to test that.
        </p>

            <figcaption>Coroutines provide at least twice the throughput compared to threaded synchronization
                mechanisms. Averaged across 128 runs.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            To measure the actual impact of coroutines on processing performance, we devised a benchmark comparing
            coroutines
            to conventional thread programming.
            The computational work in the
            benchmark is trivial to isolate the effect of the synchronization between threads.
            Our benchmark is promising: coroutines provide at last 2 times
            higher throughput compared to conventional threads, irrespective of buffer sizes and number of threads.

                To explore the performance of coroutines and CUDA integration in AEStream, we benchmarked four settings:

                    <li>Synchronous read-and-copy events to GPU.</li>
                    <li>Concurrent read-and-copy events to GPU with coroutines.</li>

        <h2>Discussion</h2>
        <p>
            We have demonstrated the efficiency of AEStream for event-based processing in CPU and from CPU to
            peripherals (GPU).
            Because AEStream is built around simple, functional primitives, it can arbitrarily connect inputs
            to outputs in a straight-forward Python or command-line interface. This is particularly useful for real-time
            settings
            with dedicated, parallel or neuromorphic hardware.
            Another important contribution is the PyTorch and CUDA support. Low-level CUDA programming is a non-trivial
            and error-prone endeavor that is rarely worth the effort. In the case of GPU-integration, however, we
            believe the effort is timely; efficiently sending AER data to GPUs opens the door to a host of contemporary
            machine learning
            tools, ranging from deep learning libraries like PyTorch to spiking neuron simulators like Norse to
            graphical
            libraries for
            visual inspection.
            It should be said that we have not studied AEStream in relation to other libraries, so we can only
            hypothesize how fast or slow it performs in comparison. Further benchmarks in this direction would be
            interesting.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, it is our hope that AEStream can benefit the community and lower the entrance-barrier for research
            in neuromorphic computation.
